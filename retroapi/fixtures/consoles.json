The confusion likely happened because the Daiei Store was also a sponsor of the baseball team at the time.The orange and black color is actually different from any other N64 console",

Considering the console was already released in 1996 likely not a bad idea. Although it seems to have flopped. They are pretty rare to come by and were released in 3 different package variations",
